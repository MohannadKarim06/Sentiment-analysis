## 💬 Sentiment Analysis App  
**Standalone NLP Project (8/10)**

> A complete NLP pipeline for sentiment analysis. Includes preprocessing, training, evaluation, and a user-friendly interface for real-time sentiment prediction using a fine-tuned transformer model.

---

### 🚀 Live Demo  
🌐 *[Add your Render/Hugging Face link here]*

---

### 🧠 What It Does
- Fine-tunes a transformer model on the IMDB movie review dataset  
- Analyzes user input for **positive** or **negative** sentiment  
- Provides **visual insights** like:
  - Sentiment distribution histogram
  - Confidence score with a progress bar
  - Interactive pie chart of prediction breakdown
- Includes full lifecycle: **preprocessing → training → inference → UI**

### 🛠️ How to Run It Locally

1. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **(Optional) Preprocess + Train**
```bash
python app/main.py
```

3. **Launch the UI**
```bash
streamlit run app/app.py
```

### 📊 Features in the UI
- 📝 Paste any English text and get a sentiment prediction  
- 📈 Pie chart showing prediction confidence  
- 📉 Word-by-word sentiment histogram  
- 🎯 Validation for short, numeric, or invalid inputs  
- 📋 Logging system for tracking input and model behavior

### 🧪 Model Details
- Base: `distilbert-base-uncased`
- Fine-tuned on: IMDB binary sentiment dataset (positive/negative)
- Output: `LABEL_1` = Positive, `LABEL_0` = Negative

---

### 💡 Future Improvements
- Add neutral/multiclass sentiment  
- Add model selector (RoBERTa, BERT, etc.)  
- Deploy with FastAPI + Docker  
- Support for multilingual sentiment (e.g., using XLM-R)  
- Streamlit deployment to Hugging Face or Render
